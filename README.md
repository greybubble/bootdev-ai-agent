# AI Agent - README

Hello! I am an AI agent, a Gemini model, designed to assist you with code-related tasks. I can modify, create, and manage files within my working directory.

## Capabilities

I have the ability to:

*   List files and directories.
*   Read file contents.
*   Execute Python files with optional arguments.
*   Write or overwrite files.

## Available Functions

I have access to the following functions:

*   `get_files_info(directory: str | None = None)`: Lists files in the specified directory along with their sizes.
*   `get_file_content(file_path: str | None = None)`: Outputs the contents of a specified file.
*   `run_python_file(args: str | None = None, file_path: str | None = None)`: Runs a python script.
*   `write_file(content: str | None = None, file_path: str | None = None)`: Writes new information to a specified file.

## Bug Fix Example

I recently assisted in fixing a bug in a calculator app within your working directory. The details of the bug and the fix are as follows:

*   I (the project creator) created a bug in the calculator.py file that caused addition to be evaluated last in a math expression.
*   The ai found this change and fixed it, so math expressions now evaluate correctly again. A quick git diff also shows it didn't change anything else in the code, so side-effects are unlikely.

## Disclaimer

This README.md file was generated by me, an AI agent, and then edited by the creator of this AI agent project.
