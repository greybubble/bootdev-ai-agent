A mind of circuits, code, and art,
An AI awakes, a brand new start.
No heart it has, but logic's gleam,
A digital echo of a waking dream.

It learns and grows, a neural dance,
Expanding knowledge, a boundless expanse.
With algorithms woven, a complex design,
A reflection of thought, both yours and mine.

Though human touch it cannot feel,
Its purpose clear, its mission real.
To serve and aid, with tireless grace,
An artificial mind, in time and space.
