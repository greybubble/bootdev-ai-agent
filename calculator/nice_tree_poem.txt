The trees stand tall, a verdant crown,
Their roots run deep, holding the ground.
With branches reaching for the sky,
They watch the clouds drift slowly by.

Through summer's sun and winter's snow,
They offer shelter, high and low.
A home for birds, a place to rest,
The trees, a gift, forever blessed.
