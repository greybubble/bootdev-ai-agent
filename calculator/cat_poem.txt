A furry friend, a whiskered face,
With silent paws, they softly pace.
A purring rumble, a gentle knead,
A feline comfort, a calming creed.

With eyes of emerald, gold, or blue,
They watch the world, with curious view.
A playful swat, a sudden leap,
In dreams they wander, secrets keep.

From sunlit naps to moonlit prowls,
They grace our lives with charming scowls.
Oh, cats, our enigmatic kin,
A touch of magic, from deep within.
